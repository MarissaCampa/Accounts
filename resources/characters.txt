Hello! This is Marissa Campa
and this is an explanation video of my C++ project "Accounts"

- Show main menu
- Open a new account (Regular)
- Show all accounts
- Open a new account (Checking)
- Withdraw from checking account
- Open a new account (Savings)
- Deposit to savings account
- Open a new account (Trust) 
- Deposit to trust
- Withdraw from trust
- Withdraw from trus
- Try again trust

There is a base class Account that can be instanciated as a regular account. And there are two accounts that inherit from this class, the Checking and the Savings accounts. 

There is also, a Trust account that inherits from the Savings Account.

There is an account manager class that has a vector of unique pointers to the base class Account, and each pointer get's initialized to the specific account created

The accounts vector of pointers to the base class Account is used to facilitate polymorphic calls to specific account methods from the Account Manager.
